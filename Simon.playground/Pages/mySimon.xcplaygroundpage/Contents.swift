 # Introduction
 - - - 
 In This tutorial you will be learning how to make the game Simon. This game consist of rounds where each round starts when the player hits the **start** button. A round in the game consists of the computer lighting up one or more buttons in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that pattern by pressing the buttons. If the pattern is entered correctly, one button is added to the pattern and the player moves to the next round. If the incorrect pattern is entered then the player will get the chance to retry that round.
 \
 On the right is a working version of the game. Play around with it to see how it works. When you are ready get started making your own, press **next**.
